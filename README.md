## OpinionSpot
The `OpinionSpot` project is a React application that showcases a collection of reviews from different individuals. This app was developed to explore React hooks, with a particular focus on mastering `useState`. 
The project allows users to explore the reviews by navigating through them using `next` and `previous` buttons. Additionally, there is a button to display a `random review`. The reviews include information such as the person's name, job, and their review text.
The project also provides an optional integration of `React Icons` for additional styling and visual appeal.
